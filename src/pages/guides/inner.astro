              <p>
                Over the last 10 years, Google has been constantly revising
                their search results, both in terms of aesthetics and function.
                10 blue links are no longer the norm. The SERPs (search engine
                results pages) are now jam-packed with sitelinks, local packs,
                knowledge graphs, instant answers, video and image carousels,
                not to mention tabs for flights, images, news, maps and more.
              </p>

              <p>
                Featured snippets have been growing in stature over recent
                years, with Ahrefs releasing a study showing that featured
                snippets now appear for around 12.5% of queries. The study also
                shows that featured snippets are far more likely to appear for
                informational searches, rather than navigational or
                transactional searches.
              </p>

              <p>
                For content strategies then, featured snippets should offer an
                interesting opportunity. At first glance it seems as though they
                are most useful for top of the funnel acquisition, and this is
                mostly true. However, there are also opportunities within
                pricing tables and list based snippets. Regardless though, it’s
                important that the right type of featured snippets are targeted
                for the right reasons, which is why we have created this
                article!

                We briefly discussed this in our previous article but wanted to
                dive into a little more detail here. Having criteria upon which
                to base your targeting decisions will provide structure and
                guidelines to your operational plans. Featured snippets can be
                very enticing, so these criteria should help you remain focussed
                on your SEO goals:

                This may seem like an obvious one, but when you type in the
                query, does a featured snippet appear? If yes, you can be
                confident that Google considers it to be the correct type of
                search for a featured snippet. Bear in mind though that more and
                more queries are being returned with a featured snippet. If one
                doesn’t appear right now, that doesn’t mean that it won’t in the
                future. It may also mean that Google doesn’t consider the
                current answers provided by websites to be sufficient. It’s a
                slightly riskier tactic to assign resources to a featured
                snippet that doesn’t already exist, so it’s worth approaching it
                with caution. Would this be part of your normal content
                strategy? Do you stand a good chance of ranking on page one?
                Regardless of the potential for a featured snippet, would this
                search term (and subsequent content) deliver valuable traffic to
                your site?
              </p>

              <p>
                How do you find these featured snippets? Through a combination
                of more traditional research as well as utilising tools such as
                SEMrush or Ahrefs. For example, SEMrush allow you to find
                featured snippets that are currently occupied by your
                competitors, which is pretty handy! Both of these platforms do a
                good job of explaining how to find featured snippets (alongside
                Moz) so jump over to their websites for more info on sniffing
                out opportunities.

                A key part of a content strategy is establishing your buyer
                personas and their corresponding buying funnel. Without this you
                run the risk of creating content for the sake of it. Targeting
                snippets that have low search volumes or result in virtually no
                additional traffic may help you gain brownie points with your
                management or client for a short period. But ultimately traffic
                and conversions are the end game.
